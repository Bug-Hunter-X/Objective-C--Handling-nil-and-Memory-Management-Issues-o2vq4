In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect handling of `nil` values when working with objects.  For instance, sending a message to a `nil` object will usually result in an exception, but this might not be immediately obvious and the application crashes silently.  Consider this code:

```objectivec
NSString *myString = nil;
NSInteger length = [myString length]; // This will crash!
```

Another insidious error is related to memory management, particularly in older projects not using ARC. Improper handling of retain/release cycles can lead to memory leaks or unexpected crashes.  For example, forgetting to release an object after its usage can lead to a gradual memory buildup and eventual app termination.

```objectivec
// Non-ARC example demonstrating a potential memory leak
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... use myObject ...
// myObject is never released, causing a memory leak.
